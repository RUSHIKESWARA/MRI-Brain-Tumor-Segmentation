We need a custom loss function to train this ResUNet.So, we have used the loss function as it is from [https://github.com/nabsabraham/focal-tversky-unet/blob/master/losses.py](https://github.com/nabsabraham/focal-tversky-unet/blob/master/losses.py)

Project Overview
This project focuses on building and training models for tumor detection and localization using MRI images. The workflow includes classifier and segmentation models, as well as exploring advanced architectures(ResUNet).
